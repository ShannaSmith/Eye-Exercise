## About
This is a program for a web page in which two eyes follow the user's mouse movements in real time. 
         
## How To Run
          1.  load the index.html file in your browser.
          2.  Move your mouse and watch the eyes follow your cursor.
         
         
## Roadmap of Future Improvements
         Improve UI by allowing the user to select the shape of the eyes and the color of the background. 
         I would also like to add code that allows the user choose a nose and mouth to create a more complete face.
